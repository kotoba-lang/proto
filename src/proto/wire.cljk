(ns proto.wire
  "Protocol Buffers **wire format** — the bytes, not the schema.

  `proto.core` compiles a schema-as-data into `.proto` source text. This
  namespace is the other half: it reads and writes the encoded bytes, as a
  total function from data to data with no host interop at all.

  ## Why this exists in this shape

  It was written for signature verification, and that requirement drives the
  whole design. Protocols like Storj's sign a message by serializing it,
  signing those bytes, and putting the signature in a field of the same
  message. To *check* such a signature you must remove the signature field and
  reproduce the remaining bytes **exactly** — not equivalently, exactly. A
  decoder that drops fields it does not recognise, or that re-encodes varints
  in its own canonical form, silently produces different bytes and every
  signature fails to verify with no clue as to why.

  So `decode` is lossless. Each field keeps `:raw`, the exact byte slice it
  occupied *including its tag*, and `encode` concatenates those slices. Round
  tripping is byte-identical by construction rather than by care, unknown
  fields survive, and a non-canonical varint written by some other
  implementation comes back out exactly as it went in. Dropping one field and
  re-encoding — which is the whole verification move — is `remove-field`
  followed by `encode`.

  ## Representation

  Bytes are seqs of unsigned ints 0-255 in and out, matching the convention
  the rest of this workspace's portable `.cljc` uses (see `sigv4.core`). No
  `byte-array`, no `Uint8Array`, no reader conditionals: this file is identical
  on every runtime in the kotoba-lang ladder.

  A decoded message is a **vector of field maps** in wire order, not a map
  keyed by field number, because protobuf permits repeated occurrences of the
  same field number and their order is significant.

      {:field-number 2
       :wire-type    :length-delimited
       :value        (104 105)   ; payload only — no tag, no length prefix
       :raw          (18 2 104 105)}

  Interpretation (which field number means what) belongs to the caller; this
  namespace never guesses. See `varint-value`, `bytes->utf8` and friends for
  turning `:value` into something meaningful once you know the schema.

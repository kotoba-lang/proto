;; The whole suite on nbb — no build step, no JVM.
;;
;; `proto.core` and `proto.wire` are `.cljc`, and until now `clojure -M:test`
;; was the only runtime that ever ran them, so a defect in the ClojureScript
;; half of either was invisible here (ADR-2608190100).
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:$(clojure -Spath -M:test)" run-tests.cljs
;;
;; This is the WHOLE suite, not a subset: `proto.core-test` was `.clj` by
;; extension only — it requires nothing but `clojure.test`,
;; `kotoba.lang.text` and `proto.core`, and runs unchanged here — so it is
;; `.cljc` now and both runtimes report 13 tests / 89 assertions.
;;
;; Every deftest-bearing namespace is named BOTH in the require and in the
;; `run-tests` call: requiring registers the vars, only `run-tests` runs
;; them, and a runner naming a subset prints the same `Ran N tests` shape as
;; one naming all of them.

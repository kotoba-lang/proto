  "Tests for the wire codec.

  The scalar vectors are the worked examples from the Protocol Buffers
  encoding specification, and every one of them is independently checkable by
  arithmetic rather than by trusting this implementation — `96 01` is
  0x16 + 1*128 = 150, `9E A7 05` is 0x1E + 0x27*128 + 5*16384 = 86942. That
  matters: a codec tested only against its own output agrees with itself and
  with nothing else.

  The round-trip tests are the ones that protect signature verification. They
  assert byte-identity, not equivalence, over inputs that a careless decoder
  would quietly normalise: unknown fields, repeated fields, and a varint
  written non-canonically."
